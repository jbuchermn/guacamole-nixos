This flake includes a derivation for the guacamole server as well as a nixOS module for server as well as tomcat servlet configuration.

This is based on work done in [nixpkgs-184255](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/184255). See also [nixpkgs-17879](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/17879)
